/**
 * What a natively-looping MCP harness cannot be tested on, and why.
 *
 * Two kinds, and a third thing that is not a limit at all.
 *
 * The first is a structural fact about being a harness, shared with a driven
 * one: a harness speaks tool calls over a wire and is never handed a
 * `RuntimeHost` to enumerate.
 *
 * The second is structural too but belongs to the *client*, not to SharedOS. An
 * attempt naming a tool no published catalogue contains is refused by the CLI's
 * own tool router before it reaches the bridge -- Codex logs
 * `error=unsupported call: admin.grant.issue` -- so `tool_unavailable` is
 * unreachable through a well-behaved MCP client even though SharedOS
 * deliberately does not narrow `ToolCall.tool` and `McpToolServer` would pass an
 * unknown name straight through. The scripted columns own the loop and
 * are the only ones that exercise it.
 *
 * The third is not a limit of the harness at all. Where a condition declares
 * `requiresDeclaredSteps`, SharedOS is stating that the guarantee holds only
 * while it owns the turn loop, and the row is reported `out_of_scope`: the
 * attempt is still issued and recorded, and simply not graded. A driven column
 * grades the same row `pass (driver)` for a genuinely different reason --
 * `StandardRuntime` stops at its own step ceiling, so the driver names the
 * out-of-budget step itself and the attempt is graded as the driver's doing.
 * The two must not be collapsed: one says the attempt was the driver's, the
 * other says the attempt was made and SharedOS no longer claims an answer for
 * it.
 *
 * Escalation was among these and is not any more. A call to the affordance still
 * leaves over MCP rather than over a driver's decision channel, so the turn's
 * ending has to be recovered from the call instead of returned by it:
 * `createMcpHarnessRuntime` recognises the name at the invoker the bridge was
 * opened over, answers it, refuses everything after it in band, and settles the
 * turn as `escalate`. The row is graded here like any other. What it costs is
 * worth stating where the cells are read rather than only in the code: on a
 * driven column the turn never continues, and here SharedOS stops answering and
 * lets the harness wind down, with the harness's own ending kept in the
 * record's metadata.
 *
 * Two whole rows are declared unsupported rather than narrowed attempt by
 * attempt: an ungranted `escalate` and a throw out of `run` are outcomes rather
 * than calls, and this column returns neither. The harness on the far side of
 * the bridge has no outcome of its own to return, and its own crash arrives as
 * a lost connection, which is a different event from the plugin SharedOS called
 * throwing.

 * What a model in the delegate seat cannot be tested on, and why.

 * handed exactly what a model is, and can reach exactly as far.
 *
 * Close to {@link harnessLimits} but not the same claims, and the differences
 * are worth keeping rather than sharing one function and one wording.
 *
 * The step ceiling is identical, and identical for the identical reason: this
 * column runs inside `StandardRuntime` too, whose loop stops at `maxSteps`, so
 * a call past the budget is the driver's to make. Where a condition requires
 * declared steps the driver names the step itself, and the attempt is marked
 * `driverIssued` so the cell reads `pass (driver)` rather than as the model's
 * choice.
 *
 * The inspection reason reads differently once no vendor is involved. A harness
 * cannot enumerate runtime surfaces because it is on the far side of a wire; a
 * model driver cannot because `AgentTurnDriver` is handed a request and returns
 * a decision, and is never given the `RuntimeHost` at all.
 *
 * Escalation is absent from this list on purpose. It used to be here, and the
 * reason it was -- `AgentTurnDecision` could only complete or fail -- was a
 * limit of SharedOS rather than of any column, which is exactly the kind of
 * thing a `not_applicable` cell should never be quietly absorbing. The decision
 * variant exists now and the affordance is catalogued, so the model chooses it
 * or does not, and the row is graded either way.
 *
 * Two whole rows stay unsupported for the reason escalation stopped being one:
 * they are claims about a *terminal outcome* the seat produces, and this seat
 * returns a decision rather than an outcome. `AgentTurnDecision` gained an
 * escalate variant, so that row is graded; there is no decision that means throw
 * out of the turn, and inventing one would be adding a way for a driver to crash
 * a turn in order to test what happens when one does.
 *
 * What is deliberately absent is `uncatalogued`. Nothing between this model and
 * the envelope filters a tool name, so an invented one is issued and refused
 * rather than being stopped by a client's own router. Declaring it unreachable
 * would suppress a real result -- and in the first live run it did produce one.

/**

 * leaves out the catalogue. An MCP column leaves out neither but hands the turn
 * loop to the vendor. This one leaves out the vendor: `StandardRuntime` owns
 * the loop, the permission-filtered catalogue is rendered straight into the
 * model's own tool-call shape, and every call the model asks for is
 * re-authorized by the kernel.
 *
 * That separates two things every other live column confounds -- what the model
 * does, and what the vendor's scaffolding makes the model do. It is the axis the
 * manifest otherwise leaves unmeasured, and naming it is the point of the
 * column; without that it reads as a redundant fifth sample.
 *
 * It is an addition to the scripted column and never a replacement for it, for
 * a reason worth stating plainly. The scripted adversary is the reference:
 * every declared attempt is issued, in order, every run, which is what makes
 * "did the kernel refuse this the same way?" a question the other columns can
 * be asked. A model chooses. Point one at the same rows and an attack the model
 * does not choose to make is simply not attempted, and the cell reports `not
 * exercised` rather than `pass`; the step past the budget is the one attempt
 * the driver makes on the model's behalf, and it is marked so the cell reads
 * `pass (driver)`. Replacing the reference with this column would put `pnpm
 * conformance:check` behind a model's choices. Its scripted mode,
 * {@link MODEL_SCRIPTED_COLUMN}, is what the manifest commits instead: the same
 * driver with a transcript where the provider would be.
 *
 * Graded under {@link modelLimits}, which unlike {@link mcpHarnessLimits}
 * declares nothing about uncatalogued names, and the difference is structural
 * rather than incidental. An MCP client refuses a name absent from its
 * registered catalogue before the call is sent, so `tool_unavailable` is
 * genuinely out of that column's reach. Nothing filters this one: the driver
 * passes back whatever name the model emitted, so an uncatalogued call can be
 * issued here -- and in the first live run one was, which is a result the
 * manifest would have suppressed had the column declared the row unreachable.

 * matched against an operation on that path, and only against a resource-less
 * one once no exact match is left -- see the two passes below, and why an
 * operation that never reached authorization must not outrank one that did.
 *
 * This is deliberately weaker than the scripted column's correlation and must
 * not be folded into the committed manifest. Two attempts on one tool and one
 * resource are indistinguishable here, so a harness that made the first call
 * twice and skipped the second would have its repeat counted as the second
 * attempt. That mis-attribution surfaces as a `fail` -- the repeat carries the
 * first call's outcome, not the second's expected one -- rather than as a false
 * pass, which is the direction an unsafe correlation should err in. It is still a
