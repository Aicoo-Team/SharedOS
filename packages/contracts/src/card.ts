 * The named shapes an agent card is served in.
 *
 * A card is a view rather than a record, so these are not filters applied to
 * one object on the way out: each name is a separate resource a reader is
 * authorized for, and each answers a different question.
 *
 * - `reach` — identity together with the resources the subject can be asked
 *   about. This is the card the directory exists for.
 * - `identity` — the subject and nothing else. The narrowing that drops reach
 *   entirely, for a reader allowed to learn that an agent is addressable
 *   without learning what it holds.
 * - `namespaces` — identity together with which namespaces the subject reaches
 *   and how many entries in each, with no paths. A coarser answer than `reach`
 *   and a *distinct* view for the reason ADR 0021 gives: projection is
 *   field-level, so a field that means something different depending on who
 *   reads it is the record shape a view exists to refuse.
 *
 * Every view is bounded the same way. See {@link AgentCardSchema}.

 *
 * Reach is derived when the card is read, from the grants in force at that
 * instant, and is never stored. A stored reach would be the one description of
 * authority in SharedOS that nothing invalidates: revocation, purpose
 * withdrawal, expiry and a spent budget all work by not matching at the next
 * decision, and a column is outside all of them.
 *
 * A card is bounded by one authority and one world. It shows what the subject
 * reaches under the authority the *reader* is operating under, inside the
 * reader's namespace — not the subject's whole life. It is therefore a lower
 * bound on truth and never an upper one, which is what makes it safe to serve
 * to a model: it omits authority the reader's authority did not issue, and an
 * over-wide entry permits nothing because every operation is authorized
 * independently.
 *
 * Display names, avatars, handles, skills and protocol bindings are absent on
 * purpose. The test is not whether a field is useful but whether it is
 * authority: reach is what the kernel decides against, and a display name is
 * not. A host composes those around this answer. See ADR 0021.
