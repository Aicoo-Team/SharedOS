     * fail-closed behaviour is untouched. What it buys is that a host running a
     * consent workflow can name the capability an approval is about instead of
     * reconstructing it from prose (ADR 0019).

     * Present on a `no_matching_grant` denial from an authorization check, and

     * code: it is asked about a tool's declared ceiling rather than a call, so a
     * description built there would name more authority than an operation
     * needed. Of the other codes, `grant_exhausted` names a grant that exists,
     * `host_policy_denied` names one that exists and was overridden, and the
     * infrastructure denials name a fact SharedOS could not establish; for all
     * of them, issuing a grant is not the remedy, and a description would say
     * that it is.
     *
     * It restates the caller's own request and context and reveals nothing
     * further. It does not say whether the path exists, whether any grant for it
     * exists, or who holds one -- and it must not be extended to, because a
     * denial that answered those would be an existence oracle.
