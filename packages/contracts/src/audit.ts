 * `source` (`kernel` or `envelope`, who performed or refused the operation;
 * never on `turn.ended`), `cause` (which situation a coarse `reason` stood in
 * for, on `tool.invoked`), `failClosed` (present and `true` when SharedOS could
 * not establish a fact and refused rather than guess), `consumed` (whether a
 * bounded use was spent, on `authorization.checked`), `endedBy` (`envelope` or
 * `runtime`, who ended a failed turn), `requestedAuthority` (what an escalation
 * asks for), and `id`, the record's identity and the only safe idempotency key.
