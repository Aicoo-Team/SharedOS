/**
 * Harness configuration, which declares a CONNECTION and nothing else.

 * This is the architectural rule the whole boundary rests on, and it is worth
 * stating where the files are generated:
 *
 *     Harness configuration declares a CONNECTION.
 *     SharedOS declares the TOOLS.
 *     SharedOS capabilities declare the AUTHORITY.
 *     RuntimeHost is the only EXECUTION path.
 *
 * So every emitter here produces a few lines naming a URL. None of them enumerate
 * tools, and none of them can: the catalogue is resolved per turn from the access
 * context, and a file on disk cannot know who is asking. A harness setting that
 * looks like authorization -- Codex's `enabled_tools`, Claude's `allowedTools` --
 * is defense in depth and UX policy over a catalogue SharedOS already filtered,
 * never the thing that decides.

 * (`dsh plugin --profile <name> add @deepseek-ai/dsh-mcp-client`). A patch
 * activates a plugin; it does not fetch one.
 *
 * `@deepseek-ai/dsh-mcp-client` then performs `tools/list`, converts the
 * schemas, and registers each result through `ctx.tools.register()`. Nothing in
 * this file describes a tool, for the same reason as the others.

/**
 * Pi's `.mcp.json`, read by an MCP extension.
 *
 * Pi ships no MCP client. Reaching an MCP server therefore requires an
 * extension, and *which* extension is a host choice rather than something
 * SharedOS mandates -- `pi-mcp-adapter` is the one this repository is exercised
 * against, and anything with the same job would serve. The file shape below is
 * that adapter's, which happens to be Claude Code's shape with its own
 * lifecycle and timeout keys.
 *
 * The effect is not identical to a native client, and the difference is worth
 * knowing when reading a Pi column. The adapter registers a single `mcp` proxy
 * tool and discovers the catalogue behind it on demand, so Pi's model calls
 * `mcp({tool: "files.read", ...})` rather than `files.read`, and the
 * harness-facing surface is one tool wide.
 *
 * None of that reaches SharedOS: what arrives at the bridge is an ordinary
 * `tools/call` naming the canonical tool, authorized exactly like any other.
 * Which is the point of keeping the harness-facing alias out of authorization.
 *
 * `lifecycle: "eager"` connects at startup rather than on first use, so the
 * catalogue is fetched inside the turn that opened the bridge rather than at
 * some later moment the turn may already have closed.
