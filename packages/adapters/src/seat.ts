 * there is nothing for the kernel to authorize, because the seat is saying the
 * turn is over and a human has to decide. It is recognised by name, so an

 * envelope, and with it the envelope's check that the tool was published to
 * this agent. So the catalogue is read first: a seat that names the affordance
 * without holding it (a hallucinated tool, one remembered from another turn, a
 * harness that guessed) has its call passed through to be refused
 * `tool_unavailable` like any other unpublished name. Anything less would hand
 * every seat a channel to the owner that no host granted, on the strength of a
