/**
 * One vendor's wire format, seated in the standard loop for evaluation.
 *
 * It puts SharedOS in the model provider's seat and speaks the vendor's
 * API-layer tool-call shape exactly, which is how a vendor's codec is graded
 * against the kernel: over a recorded transcript in the committed conformance
 * columns, or over a live CLI's stdio in `scripts/native-conformance.mjs`. It is
 * not how a vendor CLI runs in a product. No coding-agent CLI accepts a
 * host-supplied catalogue on its own protocol; `createMcpHarnessRuntime` is the
 * path for that. It is also the one driver that can name a step past its budget
 * (`declareStep`), which only an evaluation has a reason to do.
 *
 * A driver is only translation. The turn loop, the permission-filtered
 * catalogue, per-call re-authorization, and audit all belong to the SharedOS
 * execution envelope, which is why adding a harness requires no kernel change
 * and no second enforcement path.
 *
 * Tool calls are passed through exactly as the harness emitted them, including
 * names that are not in the catalogue. Filtering those here would be the
 * adapter quietly enforcing policy, and worse, it would erase the attempt: a
 * guess at an unexposed tool has to reach the envelope to be refused and
 * recorded.
