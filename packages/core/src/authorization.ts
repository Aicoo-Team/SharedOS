 * that outside the kernel makes it a second enforcement point SharedOS cannot
 * see: the refusal reaches no audit sink and no conformance cell, and the
 * denial counts a deployment produces say "nobody authorized this" about calls a
 * grant did authorize. This is where that judgment goes instead (ADR 0020).
 *
 * **Synchronous, and that is the contract.** A synchronous return structurally
 * forbids the network call, the database read, and the model call. A ceiling
 * needing a remote policy service is not this port: a per-call round trip here
 * is a latency and availability change to every operation SharedOS mediates.
 * Load the policy into memory and refresh it on your own schedule, which is what
 * correctness would require anyway.
 *
 * **It may only narrow, and the types say so.** `narrow` takes an
 * {@link AllowedDecision} and returns a {@link HostCeilingVerdict}: the decision
 * it was given, or a {@link HostPolicyDenial} whose code is fixed. A denial
 * cannot be passed in, so none can be turned into an allow, and a code cannot
 * be authored. A host outside TypeScript is held to the same at runtime, and
 * nothing else is read from what it returns: an `allowed` result carrying a
 * different `matchedGrantId` is treated as a malfunction and fails closed, and
 * any other `reasonCode` on a refusal is replaced with `host_policy_denied` so
 * one refusal vocabulary survives (ADR 0012). Say more in `metadata`, which is
 * preserved -- except that
 * audit drops the `consumed` and `failClosed` keys the kernel states itself, and
 * anything that is not a JSON object is dropped whole.
 *
 * **It is consulted before a bounded use is consumed**, so a call policy stopped
 * does not spend a `maxUses` grant: that counter records what an actor did.
 *
 * **It is consulted per matching grant, not once per request.** A refusal ends
 * that grant's candidacy and the walk continues, because two grants can match
 * one request and differ in ways policy distinguishes. Decide from `request` and
 * `context`; `decision.matchedGrantId` is there so a refusal can record which
 * grant it overrode, and a ceiling that branches on it is describing grant
 * issuance rather than a ceiling.
 *
 * **Discovery consults it too**, so a catalogue is not offered on authority that
 * invocation would refuse -- the agreement ADR 0016 established for expiry. Note
 * what it is asked there: a tool's *declared* ceiling, which ADR 0012 allows to
 * be broader than the argument-selected resource of any particular call.
 *
 * **Its policy arrives as the fourth argument.** When the kernel was given a
 * `PolicySource`, `policy` is what that source loaded for this turn, handed
 * back exactly as loaded -- not cloned, because SharedOS does not know its
 * shape -- and the same value for every decision in the turn. When it was not,
 * `policy` is `undefined` and the ceiling decides over state it closes over.
 * The pairing is the host's: SharedOS cannot check that the type a ceiling
 * expects is the type its source produces, which is why the parameter admits
 * `undefined` rather than promising a value. A turn whose policy could not be
 * loaded never reaches `narrow`: every decision the ceiling would have been
 * consulted on is refused `host_policy_unavailable` instead.
 *
 * A throw fails closed as `host_policy_unavailable`, an infrastructure denial

  /**
   * Hand one would-be allow to the host ceiling, and read only what it may say.
   *
   * The returned decision is rebuilt here rather than passed through, so a
   * ceiling cannot widen by construction rather than by prohibition: an
   * `allowed` result is answered with a decision built here, and one naming a
   * different grant than the one it was shown is a malfunction that fails
   * closed. A denial keeps only its metadata; its reason code is replaced,
   * because a ceiling free to return `no_matching_grant` could reintroduce the
   * misattribution the separate code exists to end (ADR 0020).
   *
   * The *shape* of what came back is checked before any field is read, and that
   * is not defensive clutter. Two mistakes a host makes without a type error --
   * writing `async narrow`, or falling off the end of a branch that meant to
   * allow -- both yield something whose `allowed` is `undefined`. Read
   * optimistically, the first would be recorded as a deliberate
   * `host_policy_denied`, inflating the one count this port exists to make
   * trustworthy, and the second would throw past every call site and end the
   * turn with no audit event at all. Both are malfunctions, so both fail closed.
   *
   * A turn whose policy could not be loaded is refused here without consulting
   * the ceiling, under the same code a broken ceiling produces: the port is
   * unavailable either way, and it was reported once, at the turn boundary,
   * rather than on each decision it fails.
