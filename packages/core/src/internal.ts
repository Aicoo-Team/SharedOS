 * there are two answers rather than one.
 *
 * Expiry is observed at the *operation* instant. It is a property the grant
 * already carried when the turn began, so refusing it part-way through costs no
 * store read and leaks no store state -- the grant set the turn holds already
 * says when its own authority ends, and honouring that needs nothing but a
 * clock.
 *
 * Everything else is observed at the instant the turn's authority was resolved.
 * Revocation and purpose withdrawal are store-side edits, invisible without
 * re-reading the store, and `SharedOSKernel` freezes a resolved authority for
 * the whole turn -- so they are observed by the *next* turn. `issuedAt` and
 * `notBefore` are frozen for the opposite reason: they would *widen* authority
 * mid-turn, and a request must carry the authority it was admitted with rather
 * than acquire more while it runs.
 *
 * The split is therefore directional, not a matter of where the fact came from:
 * the operation's clock may only take authority away. See ADR 0016 for the
