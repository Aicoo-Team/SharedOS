 *
 * On the call object, not on the handler and not on `call.id`. A handler with
 * one prepared slot is only safe while no two calls are in flight through it,
 * which stopped being true when the kernel began holding one effective
 * catalogue for a whole turn (ADR 0026): concurrent calls then shared this
 * handler, and the second to resolve its requirement overwrote the first's
 * envelope. Keying on `call.id` narrows that to calls that share an id, where
 * it is worse -- the guard below passes and one call's authorization decision
 * is spent on another call's recipient. The kernel passes one frozen `ToolCall`
 * to both hooks, so the object itself is the only key that identifies the call
 * rather than something a caller chose.
