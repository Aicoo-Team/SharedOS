/**
 * The two signals of a turn that drains before it stops.
 *
 * `signal` is the one above: the host's cancellation and the turn's deadline,
 * and the only one a tool handler is given. `draining` is aborted first, `graceMs`
 * ahead of the deadline, and says only that the turn takes nothing new. What is
 * already inside a handler is left alone until `signal`, so it answers with its
 * real outcome rather than being stopped half-way through an effect. The grace
 * is inside the limit: `timeoutMs` is still when the turn ends at the latest.
 *
 * `drain` starts the same thing early, for an ending the envelope makes itself,
 * and the hard stop then follows after the grace or at the deadline, whichever
 * comes first. With no grace the two signals are one and `drain` is `abort`.
 * A host's own cancellation never drains: it asked for a stop, and gets it.
