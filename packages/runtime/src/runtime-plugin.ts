 * Both layers that contain one take it: `SharedOSExecutor`, whose catch ends
 * the turn `runtime_failed`, and `StandardRuntime`, whose catch ends it
 * `driver_failed`. A terminal code says a turn stopped and does not say why;
 * the thrown error is the only thing that does, so it is handed over whole and
 * unwrapped, because its stack is what names the origin.
 *
 * It reaches nothing else. A `ProtocolError.message` is read by the model, and
 * an `ExecutionEvent` becomes part of an `ExecutionRecord`, which travels
 * further than an audit sink; a thrown message may carry anything the thrower
 * had in scope. This is a host-side sink for host-side logs, in the position
 * `SharedOSKernel.onAuditError` occupies for the same reason.
 *
 * Observational. One that throws is ignored -- it cannot replace an outcome
 * already decided -- and a turn behaves identically with none installed.
 * Cancellation never reaches it: a turn stopped by the deadline or by the
 * caller's signal ends `cancelled`, which is a decision rather than a defect.
 *
 * The kernel makes the same promise about a provider's throw, under
 * `SharedOSKernelOptions.onProviderError`. A host wanting both installs both;
 * they are separate because they are about different things failing, and the
 * turn's identifiers are not the ones a mediated call has.

 * turn one failure into two is a liability rather than a diagnostic.
 *
 * It delegates rather than repeating the rule. The kernel contains a provider's
 * throw and the runtime contains a plugin's, and the same promise is made to a
 * host about both; two implementations of one promise is how it stops being
 * true in one of them. Core owns it because the dependency runs runtime → core
 * and cannot run back.
