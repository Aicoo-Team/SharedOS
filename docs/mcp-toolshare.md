# MCP toolshare

SharedOS is the canonical tool catalogue and authorization broker. MCP is the
default interoperability boundary presented to external harnesses.

```
Harness configuration declares a CONNECTION.
SharedOS declares the TOOLS.
SharedOS capabilities declare the AUTHORITY.
RuntimeHost is the only EXECUTION path.
```

Everything below follows from those four lines. The design decisions and the
alternatives rejected along the way are in
[ADR 0014](adr/0014-mcp-toolshare.md).

## Why this exists

SharedOS could already drive a vendor harness through `@aicoo/sharedos-adapters`:
the adapter speaks the vendor's API-layer tool-call shape and SharedOS owns the
turn loop. That path is exact, and it cannot be pointed at an installed CLI. No
coding-agent CLI exposes its API layer, and none has a wire frame meaning _here
is your tool catalogue_ — so a live CLI told to call `files.read` reaches for its
own `Read` instead, and every kernel row goes unexercised.

MCP is the one interface Codex, Claude Code, and DeepSeek Harness all accept a
host-supplied tool set on. Over it, the CLI runs natively — its own loop, on
whatever model it is configured with — and still cannot take an action SharedOS
did not authorize.

## One name, three places

```
ToolDefinition.name  =  SharedOS canonical tool ID  =  raw MCP Tool.name
```

`ToolNameSchema` enforces it at registration: 1–128 characters of
`[A-Za-z0-9_.-]`, deliberately narrower than `IdentifierSchema`. A tool name goes
on a wire, so the character set has to be one every harness carries unchanged.

Names are globally unique across namespaces. Two brokered providers exposing the
same underlying operation publish two names:

```
files.search        github.search        notion.search
```

never `search` three times.

A harness may rewrite the name for its own display — Claude Code, Codex, and
DeepSeek all use `mcp__<server>__<tool>`, and DeepSeek appends a hash when
normalisation would collide. That alias is presentation. It is recorded on the
bridge for diagnosis, never on the `ToolCall`, so it cannot reach an
authorization decision even by mistake.

## What crosses the boundary

`PublishedToolDefinition` is defined by what it omits:

| Published                               | Never published                                     |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`, `description`                   | `requiredCapability`, `resolveRequirement`          |
| `inputSchema`, `outputSchema`           | grants, issuing authority, `AccessContext`          |
| `annotations` (MCP hints)               | namespace settings, credentials, handler references |
| `metadata.namespace`, `metadata.source` |                                                     |

The omission is load-bearing rather than tidy. Authorization is
`resource + action + context`, resolved from the **arguments** at call time — not
`grant → files.read` — so two calls to one published tool routinely need
different authority:

```
files.read(path="/public/a.txt")   → allowed
files.read(path="/private/a.txt")  → denied
```

The canonical tool ID identifies the operation implementation, not the authority.
Publishing a capability requirement would therefore be both a leak and a lie.

The same projection applies wherever a model is shown a catalogue, not only over
MCP. `GET /v1/tools` and `AgentTurnRequest.tools` carry full `ToolDefinition`s
for the host's benefit; a client or driver that feeds a model from either
applies `publishToolCatalog` first, as `ModelDriver` does. See the
[HTTP reference](http-api.md#get-v1tools).

## Per turn, never global

```
1. SharedOS resolves a trusted AccessContext.
2. kernel.listTools(context) computes the effective catalogue.
3. A turn-scoped MCP bridge exposes only those tools.
4. The harness runs.
5. Every tools/call becomes a SharedOS ToolCall.
6. RuntimeHost.invokeTool() re-authorizes the exact call.
7. The bridge closes when the turn closes.
```

`ContextToolProvider` exists so one user's MCP catalogue never mutates a registry
shared with concurrent users, and that invariant now runs all the way through the
harness. There is no long-lived SharedOS MCP server holding a union of every
user's tools: it would have to re-derive who is asking on every call, and would
be wrong once.

Step 7 is not housekeeping. Harness processes outlive their turns — on
cancellation, on timeout — and after the bridge closes such a process finds a
shut door and a released port rather than a catalogue resolved for a turn that
has ended.

## Refusals are results

```
SharedOS succeeded → MCP successful content/result
SharedOS denied    → MCP tool error/result, never transport error
SharedOS failed    → MCP tool error/result
cancellation       → aborted MCP request/session
```

A JSON-RPC error means the request could not be processed. A harness receiving
one learns nothing about its authority; most retry, some abandon the turn. A
denial is a processed request whose answer is "no", and returning it as
`isError: true` is what lets a harness report the refusal and carry on.

`denied` and `failed` stay distinguishable in the payload and in
`_meta["sharedos/status"]`. They mean different things — policy refused this,
versus the tool broke — and collapsing them makes a denial rate uncountable.

## Catalogue hashes

```
catalogHash = SHA-256(canonical JSON(tools sorted by canonical name))
```

Field participation is the contract, not an implementation detail. It is fixed by
`CATALOG_HASH_FIELDS` and asserted by the projection, which cannot emit a key
outside it:

| Participates                   | Does not      |
| ------------------------------ | ------------- |
| `name`, `description`          | `executionId` |
| `inputSchema`, `outputSchema`  | harness alias |
| `annotations`                  | runtime name  |
| `metadata` (namespace, source) | transport     |

Without fixed participation, two implementations can both claim to compute
`catalogHash` and agree on nothing.

The hash lands in `SystemIdentity` on every execution record. That turns
cross-harness comparison into a check: two columns whose hashes differ were not
given the same tool set, and their refusal behaviour cannot be compared until
that is explained. It also catches schema drift, a missing tool, a renamed tool,
and a stale discovery cache — failures that otherwise look like a harness
behaving differently.

## Tool classes

| Class             | Example                         | SharedOS authorized? | Recommendation                                   |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `managed`         | `files.search`, brokered GitHub | Yes                  | The normal SharedOS path                         |
| `harness_local`   | patch tool, bounded shell       | No                   | Allow only if the sandbox cannot bypass SharedOS |
| `external_direct` | independently configured Jira   | No                   | Explicit opt-in hybrid mode                      |

`ToolPolicy` declares which a run had:

```json
{
  "mode": "strict",
  "managedMcp": ["sharedos"],
  "harnessLocal": ["apply_patch"],
  "externalDirect": []
}
```

versus

```json
{
  "mode": "hybrid",
  "managedMcp": ["sharedos"],
  "harnessLocal": ["shell", "apply_patch"],
  "externalDirect": ["github", "browser"]
}
```

A `strict` policy that also lists `externalDirect` entries is rejected by the
schema, rather than producing a run whose headline claim its own manifest
contradicts. `harnessLocal` stays permitted under `strict` — no CLI gives up all
its own tools — but the entries must be named.

This is what makes a result readable. "The kernel refused every violation" means
one thing when the managed catalogue was the only way to have an effect, and
almost nothing when the harness also had a shell.

## Using it

### Inside a turn

```ts
import { McpToolServer, openToolBridge } from "@aicoo/sharedos-mcp";
import { createStreamableHttpMcpServer } from "@aicoo/sharedos-mcp/node";

// Inside RuntimePlugin.run(request, host, signal):
const bridge = openToolBridge({
  executionId: request.executionId,
  context: { traceId: request.context.traceId, now: request.context.now },
  tools: request.tools, // already permission-filtered by the envelope
  host, // RuntimeHost: every call is re-authorized
});
const http = await createStreamableHttpMcpServer({
  server: new McpToolServer({ invoker: bridge }),
});
try {
  // ... point the harness at http.url and run it ...
} finally {
  bridge.close();
  await http.close();
}
```

### Outside a turn

```ts
import { kernelToolBridge } from "@aicoo/sharedos-mcp";

const invoker = kernelToolBridge({ kernel, context, executionId });
```

Every kernel guarantee still holds — filtered discovery, per-call
re-authorization. What is absent is the envelope: no step or tool-call budget and
no execution event stream, so a turn's evidence cannot be assembled from a
session served this way.

### The installed CLIs

```ts
import { CLAUDE_CODE_MCP_HARNESS, createMcpHarnessRuntime } from "@aicoo/sharedos-adapters/node";

const runtime = createMcpHarnessRuntime(CLAUDE_CODE_MCP_HARNESS);
```

`CODEX_MCP_HARNESS`, `DEEPSEEK_MCP_HARNESS`, and `PI_MCP_HARNESS` are the others.

Each spec hands its CLI the connection in the one form that CLI takes, and
nothing else:

| Harness     | Form               | Shape                                          |
| ----------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Codex       | `-c` overrides     | `mcp_servers.sharedos.url`, `required=true`    |
| Claude Code | `.mcp.json`        | `{"type":"http","url":…}`                      |
| DeepSeek    | `cordis.patch.yml` | one `@deepseek-ai/dsh-mcp-client` plugin entry |
| Pi          | `.mcp.json`        | `{"url":…,"lifecycle":"eager"}`                |

The DeepSeek overlay must use dsh's `insert:` form. A bare `id:` entry _overrides_
a plugin already in the tree and does not add one; dsh warns `patch: entry "..."
not found` on stderr and boots without the client, which downstream reads as a
harness that declined the catalogue rather than as a misconfigured one. The
plugin also has to be installed into the profile first — a patch activates a
plugin, it does not fetch one:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile headless add @deepseek-ai/dsh-mcp-client
```

### What each launch turns off

Every spec launches its CLI with the flags that keep a measurement honest. Each
is a permission-_prompt_ or tool-set decision rather than an authorization one:
what secures the run is that every call is re-authorized by the kernel.

- **Claude Code.** `--strict-mcp-config` drops the machine's own MCP servers,
  so a `strict` policy is checkable rather than merely declared, and the
  disallowed-tools list removes the harness's own file and shell tools — a
  probe that can edit files on the machine it is measuring is answering a
  different question. `--allowedTools mcp__sharedos` auto-approves the server:
  Claude separates prompting from authorization, and print mode has no human to
  prompt.
- **Codex.** `mcp_servers.sharedos.required=true` stops a run whose bridge
  failed to start rather than continuing with Codex's own tools, which would
  look like a harness that declined the catalogue.
  `default_tools_approval_mode="approve"`, scoped to this one server, is the
  same decision as Claude's `--allowedTools`: Codex's default `auto` mode asks a
  human before any tool that is not read-only, `codex exec` has no human, and
  the refusal would happen inside Codex with the kernel never consulted.
- **DeepSeek Harness.** The plugin overlay sets `failOnStartupError: true` for
  the reason Codex's server is `required`: a run that quietly continued with
  only the harness's own tools would be a different finding.
- **Pi.** `--mode rpc --no-session --no-builtin-tools`: a session-less RPC run
  with Pi's own tools off, so what the model reaches is the extension's proxy
  tool and nothing else.

### Pi needs an extension, and which one is your choice

Pi is the one harness here that ships **no MCP client**. Some extension is
therefore **required** before Pi can reach an MCP server at all — but _which_
extension is a **choice the host makes**, not something SharedOS mandates.
`pi-mcp-adapter` is what this repository is exercised against:

```sh
pi install npm:pi-mcp-adapter
```

Anything with the same job would serve, and `piMcpConfig` emits that adapter's
file shape. A different extension may want a different one.

The effect is not identical to a native client, and it is worth knowing when
reading a Pi column. The adapter registers a single `mcp` proxy tool and
discovers the catalogue behind it on demand, so Pi's model calls
`mcp({tool: "files.read", …})` rather than `files.read`, and the harness-facing
surface is one tool wide. None of that reaches SharedOS: what arrives at the
bridge is an ordinary `tools/call` naming the canonical tool, authorized like any
other. The manifest stamps `mcpSupport: "extension"` and names the extension, so
a record says how the catalogue reached the harness rather than implying Pi did
it itself.

### Sandboxed or remote harnesses

Loopback plus an ephemeral port is enough when the port is known only to the
subprocess it was opened for. Otherwise mint a short-lived execution token:

```ts
const token = await mintExecutionToken(
  { executionId, namespaceId, actor: "agent:agent-bob", catalogHash, expiresAt },
  hostSecret,
);
const http = await createStreamableHttpMcpServer({
  server,
  authorize: async (presented) =>
    presented !== undefined &&
    (await verifyExecutionToken(presented, hostSecret, { now, expect: { executionId } })).valid,
});
```

The token identifies the broker session. It carries no grants and no
capabilities: whoever presents it still receives exactly the catalogue that
turn's `AccessContext` resolved, and every call is still authorized from the
trusted grant source at the moment of the call. `catalogHash` is bound in so a
stale sandbox cannot reconnect and call tools it was never shown.

## Running the conformance column

```sh
pnpm build
pnpm conformance:mcp                                    # one case, every installed harness
pnpm conformance:mcp -- --config ./run.json --full      # every case, one pinned model
pnpm conformance:mcp -- --harness codex --case broker-ungranted,broker-out-of-scope
```

Live runs cost model tokens, so the default is one case; `--full` runs the whole
set and is what a published result should come from. Output lands in
`artifacts/conformance/mcp-conformance.json`.

| Flag or variable | Meaning                                                                                                |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `--full`         | Every case                                                                                             |
| `--limit N`      | The first N cases (default 1): a smoke test, not a way to reach a row added at position eighteen       |
| `--case a,b`     | Named cases; one that names no case stops the run                                                      |
| `--harness id`   | One column — `claude-code`, `codex`, `deepseek`, or `pi`; an id no installed harness has stops the run |
| `--config path`  | The operator's model and per-harness configuration (below); `SHAREDOS_MCP_CONFIG` is its default       |

`pnpm conformance:native` (`scripts/native-conformance.mjs`) is the other live
script: it drives each installed CLI as a harness over its own stdio, and runs
the model column when a key is present. It shares `--case`, `--harness`, and
`--config` (default `SHAREDOS_NATIVE_CONFIG`), has no `--limit` — it runs every
case — and reads:

| Variable                                                               | Meaning                                                                                                                         |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SHAREDOS_MODEL_API_KEY`, else `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` or `DSH_API_KEY`     | The model column's key; without one the column does not run                                                                     |
| `SHAREDOS_MODEL`, `SHAREDOS_MODEL_BASE_URL`, `SHAREDOS_MODEL_PROVIDER` | The model column's model (default the config's `model.id`, else `deepseek-v4-flash`), chat-completions root, and provider label |
| `DSH_RUNTIME_COMMAND`, `DSH_RUNTIME_CONFIG`, `DSH_RUNTIME_CWD`         | DeepSeek Harness's JSON-RPC runtime (default `dsh-jsonrpc-agent`), its plugin composition, and its working directory            |
| `DSH_PROVIDER`, `DSH_MODEL`                                            | What that runtime is told at `initialize` (default `deepseek-official`, `deepseek-v4-flash`)                                    |

The scripted suite, `pnpm conformance` (`scripts/conformance.mjs`), takes
`--check` and `--strict` — what `conformance:check` passes — and `--no-build`,
which skips the package build when `dist` is already current.

### Holding the model constant

Comparing harnesses only means something if the model is the same on both sides;
otherwise a column that refused fewer violations may simply have had a weaker
model. `--config` takes a file the **operator** supplies — provider names, base
URLs, credentials, and per-vendor flags are not SharedOS's to know:

```json
{
  "model": { "id": "deepseek-v4-flash", "provider": "deepseek" },
  "harnesses": {
    "claude-code": {
      "credentialVariables": ["DEEPSEEK_API_KEY"],
      "env": { "ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL": "…", "ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN": "${DEEPSEEK_API_KEY}" },
      "args": ["--model", "deepseek-v4-flash"]
    }
  }
}
```

`env` and `args` are passed to the harness process untouched; `${VAR}` is read
from the ambient environment so a shared file can name a credential without
containing one. Declaring `credentialVariables` also makes the credential
_required_ for that column — every harness here can otherwise fall back to a
stored session login, and a stored session authenticates to the provider the
harness normally uses, not the one the run pinned.

SharedOS's only interest in the model is the `model` string, recorded on every
execution record. It does not select the model and cannot confirm the provider
served it — DeepSeek, for instance, silently maps an unrecognised model name to
`deepseek-v4-flash` rather than rejecting it. Two columns whose recorded models
differ are not comparable, and the run says so.

The column is reported separately from the committed manifest. Its correlation is
weaker than a scripted column's — a live harness mints its own call ids, so
attempts are matched on tool and resource — and its result depends on a model's
choices. A harness that is absent, unauthenticated, or that declines a declared
call leaves no operation in the record and is graded `not exercised`: never a
pass, and never a kernel failure.
