# Release readiness

SharedOS is an open-source prerelease: the repository and the packages are
both public under Apache-2.0. It is not yet a production security boundary.
Prerelease packages use the `next` dist-tag.

## Distribution gates

- `0.1.0-alpha.0` was published by hand, and `alpha.1` and `alpha.2` since;
  `0.1.0-alpha.5` was the first published by the workflow alone. The root
  version is the next prerelease, `1.0.0-preview`.
- Trusted publishing: `release.yml` publishes from a `v*` tag with OIDC. Confirm
  on npm that every package's trusted publisher is configured and that a
  prerelease has been published through a tag alone; the repository cannot show
  whether that has happened.
- `latest` is promoted deliberately with `pnpm release:promote-latest`, never by
  a release.

Completed distribution gates: Apache-2.0 is present in every package archive,
the package set is fixed, dependency-ordered, and package-linted, prereleases
cannot become `latest` accidentally, and `founders@aicoo.io` is the private
vulnerability-reporting contact.

## Production security gates

- Install a production durable `ReplayStore` for the kernel replay gates covering
  execution IDs, message IDs, tool-call IDs and resource-operation IDs (ADR 0028).
  SharedOS now defines atomic claim, conflict rejection, result replay and fenced
  interruption semantics; testkit supplies an isolated in-memory adapter. Verify
  host storage against these rules across processes, retain identity tombstones,
  and configure host freshness policy. Omitting a store still leaves unbounded legacy operations
  unprotected; production hosts must install it. The unpublished compatibility
  epoch 2 coordinates the replay, usage and wire changes.
- Use a trusted grant store or verifier and a durable `EffectStore` extending
  that same replay store for bounded grants (ADR 0029). Reservations and committed
  uses both occupy capacity. The kernel releases reservations before admission
  when audit prevents dispatch, and never refunds after a possible effect.
  Counter-only `tryConsume` adapters cannot authorize bounded kernel effects.
- Persist operation results and pending audit events with a transactional outbox
  or equivalent protocol. A post-effect `onAuditError` callback is alerting, not
  durable recovery. Never refund usage automatically after a possible effect.
- Supply an explicit audit sink. `audit: "discard"` and `NoopAuditSink` are
  intentional test/development options and cannot satisfy production gates.
- Prove every production provider honors `AbortSignal` before committing side
  effects and enforces namespace/owner filtering inside its query.
- Add authentication, payload/rate limits, connector egress controls, secret
  handling, and host-specific policy ceilings at deployment boundaries.
- Keep the MCP bridge on loopback, or supply its `authorize` hook and terminate
  TLS ahead of it. A bridge bound past loopback without a token is reachable by
  anything on that network.
- Run host adapter conformance suites covering allow, deny, expiry,
  revocation, bounded-use races, cross-world isolation, replay, cancellation,
  and malformed provider responses.
- Require every non-standard runtime adapter to prove broker-only tool effects,
  step/tool-call/deadline handling, concurrent-run isolation, cancellation, and
  stable manifest provenance. Run untrusted adapters outside the host process.

## Already enforced in this bootstrap

- Durable replay semantics when a host `ReplayStore` is installed, including
  concurrent duplicate refusal, conflicting-input rejection and retained results.

- Deny-by-default complete capability matching with segment-safe paths.
- Separate recipient-scoped grants for messaging and target-agent execution.
- Server-derived remote authority; request bodies cannot supply grants or tools.
- Permission-filtered tool discovery and exact per-call re-authorization.
- Default-off tool namespaces, context-scoped dynamic providers, atomic
  host-owned settings updates, and invocation-time namespace rechecks.
- Mandatory tool argument parsing and immutable checked calls.
- Sanitized model context without grants or issuing authority.
- Fixed runtime security envelope, trusted runtime selection, wrapped plugin
  events, authoritative manifest provenance, and a closed per-turn broker.
- Bounded one-turn execution with step/tool-call/deadline limits, cooperative
  cancellation, and bounded cleanup.
- Runtime-validated HTTP client responses and shared wire schemas.
- Canonical resource path segments and explicit provider-facing owners.
- Package-level READMEs, distributable source and source maps, exact packed
  dependency versions, and a fresh-consumer runtime/type smoke test.
- A dependency-ordered, `next`-tagged release script with package lint, dry-run,
  registry collision checks, canonical-content recovery, and a tag-triggered
  trusted-publishing workflow.
- Apache-2.0 public prerelease metadata, Node 20/22 CI, type checks, tests,
  build, and executable sender-to-receiver quickstart.
