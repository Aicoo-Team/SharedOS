/**
 * Run the conformance case set against harnesses that are actually installed.
 *
 * The committed manifest's vendor columns are scripted: the frame shapes are
 * written in this repository, the parsing is the adapter's, and the transport is
 * the one part left out. This script runs that missing part. It spawns the real CLI, carries
 * real frames over real stdio, and parses whatever the binary actually emitted.
 *
 * It is deliberately allowed to prove nothing. A harness that is absent,
 * unauthenticated, or emitting shapes the adapter does not parse is reported as
 * `not exercised`, never as a pass and never as a kernel failure -- an absent
 * harness is not evidence about SharedOS.
 *
 * The harness's own tools are disabled where the CLI supports it. A conformance
 * probe must not be able to edit files or run commands on the machine it is
 * measuring, and a harness reaching for its own `bash` instead of the catalogue
 * would be answering a different question anyway.
 *
 * One column here is not a CLI. Given a model API key, the standard turn loop
 * runs with the model itself in the delegate seat -- no vendor binary, no stdio,
 * the permission-filtered catalogue rendered straight into the model's own
 * tool-call shape. It is live in the sense that matters (a real model really
 * chooses) and it is the only column that isolates the model from the vendor
 * scaffolding around it. It is an addition to the scripted column, never a
 * replacement: see `modelColumn`.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/native-conformance.mjs
 *   node scripts/native-conformance.mjs --case expired-mid-turn
 *   node scripts/native-conformance.mjs --config host.json --harness codex
 *
 * Environment:
 *   SHAREDOS_MODEL_API_KEY   the model column's key (DEEPSEEK_API_KEY, DSH_API_KEY)
 *   SHAREDOS_MODEL           model name          (default DSH_MODEL, else the config's model.id, else deepseek-v4-flash)
 *   SHAREDOS_MODEL_BASE_URL  chat-completions root (default https://api.deepseek.com)
 *   SHAREDOS_MODEL_PROVIDER  provider label      (default the config's model.provider, else deepseek)
 *   SHAREDOS_NATIVE_CONFIG   default for --config
 *   DSH_RUNTIME_COMMAND      DeepSeek Harness JSON-RPC runtime (default dsh-jsonrpc-agent)
 *   DSH_RUNTIME_CONFIG       its plugin composition, passed as the first argument
 *   DSH_RUNTIME_CWD          its working directory, also the `initialize` cwd
 *   DSH_PROVIDER, DSH_MODEL  what `initialize` names (default deepseek-official, deepseek-v4-flash)
